<h4 class = pheader>The Bottle Rocket Project</h4>
<p class = paragraph>My group and I set out to create the best bottle rocket in the class. We labored for weeks, finding the best possible weight distribution, fins, and even the best possible 2 liter soda bottles for our glorious creation. We had fused two bottles together against the advice of our teacher, as the risk of the bottles bursting due to the air pressure was very apparent. We used epoxy glue and heated up the bottles in the chemistry lab and layers upon layers of duct tape to make a vacuum tight seal. On the day of the competition, the bottle launched across the entire football field and I yelped like mad scientist. At that point, I knew that I would love doing this type of work for the rest of my life. The pure elation of success and the moments of realization along the way was an addictive feeling that made any type of engineering project, academic or not, worth it.</p>
